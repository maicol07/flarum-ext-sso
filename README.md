This extension enables Single Sign On (shortly SSO) for Flarum. The workflow is based on this
[post](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/2808-how-i-implemented-cross-authentication-with-flarum). The extension is useful if
you run Flarum on a subdomain, but you want to use the login mechanism of your main website or SSO system.
